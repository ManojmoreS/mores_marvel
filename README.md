## Usage

MoresMarvel Ruby client will allow to make following calls to Marvel API's all 6 resources.
`characters, comics, creators, events, series, stories`
#### Example :
###### `GET /v1/public/characters`
###### `GET /v1/public/characters/{id}`
###### `GET /v1/public/characters/{id}/comics`
```ruby
@client.fetch_all('characters')
@client.fetch_by_id('characters', '000')

# supports filters specified by Marvel API.
filters = {
  offset: 00
  limit: 00
  orderBy: 'name' or 'modified'
  modifiedSince: ''
  nameStartsWith: ''
  name: ''
}
@client.fetch_all('characters', filters)
@client.fetch_by_id('characters', '000', filters)

resource_params = {
  primary_model: ''
  id: 00
  secondary_model: ''
}
eg: `GET /v1/public/primary_model/{id}/secondary_model`
@client.fetch_filtered_by(resource_params, filters)
```
*Note: Marvel API by default return 20 records and max limit should be less than 100*
